## Description 📄

The Shape Manipulation App project is a Java program that provides a user-friendly interface for creating, manipulating, and analyzing shapes. Users can create circles and rectangles by specifying their parameters, such as coordinates and dimensions. The program allows users to perform various operations on the shapes, including calculating their areas, perimeters, and checking if a point is inside a shape.

## Usage 🛠️

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

2. **Installation**:
   - No specific installation is required. You can compile and run the program using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **How to Run**:
   - Run the program, and it will await your commands through the command-line interface (CLI).

4. **Review Output**:
   - The program will display shape information and calculations based on the commands executed.

## Commands 💬

Here's an explanation of each command and its parameters:

- `circulo [x] [y] [radius]`: Create a circle with a specified center (x, y) and radius.
- `retangulo [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2]`: Create a rectangle with specified coordinates for two opposite corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
- `area`: Calculate and display the total area of all shapes.
- `perimetro`: Calculate and display the total perimeter of all shapes.
- `inside [x] [y]`: Check if a point with coordinates (x, y) is inside any of the shapes.
- `mostra`: Display the details of all shapes.
- `end`: Exit the program.
