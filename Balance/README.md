1. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

2. **Installation**:
   - No specific installation is required. You can compile and run the program using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **How to Run**:
   - Run the program, and it will await your commands through the command-line interface (CLI).

## Commands

You can use the following commands to interact with the Balance Calculator:

- `init [name] [weight] [planet]`: Initialize a person with a name, weight on Earth, and the planet they are on.
- `massaEquivalente [planet]`: Calculate and display the person's mass equivalent on the specified planet.
- `show`: Display the current person's details.
- `end`: Exit the program.
