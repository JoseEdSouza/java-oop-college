## Description 📄

The Sequence Calculator project is a Java program that enables users to manage a sequence of numbers and perform various operations on it. Users can add or remove numbers from the sequence and calculate the sum of all the numbers in the sequence. This project is designed to provide a simple tool for performing sequence-related calculations.

## Usage 🛠️

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

2. **Installation**:
   - No specific installation is required. You can compile and run the program using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **How to Run**:
   - Run the `App` class, and it will prompt you to enter commands to perform operations on the sequence.

4. **Review Output**:
   - The program will display the results of the commands you enter, such as the sum of the sequence or the current sequence itself.

## Commands 💬

- `cadastra [valor]`: Adds a positive integer `[valor]` to the sequence. If `[valor]` is 0, the last number added is removed from the sequence.
