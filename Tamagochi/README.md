## Description 📄

The Tamagochi Simulator project is a Java program that allows users to interact with a virtual pet by entering commands through the console. The virtual pet, named Tamagochi, has attributes such as energy, hunger, cleanliness, diamonds, and age, which change based on user commands. The primary objectives of this project are to demonstrate object-oriented programming in Java and simulate the care of a virtual pet.

## Usage 🛠️

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

2. **Installation**:
   - No specific installation is required. You can compile and run the program using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **How to Run**:
   - Run the `App` class, which serves as the entry point for the program. It will provide a console interface for entering commands.

4. **Interact with the Project**:
   - Use the following commands to interact with the virtual pet:
     - `iniciar [energia] [fome] [banho]`: Initializes the Tamagochi with specified initial values for energy, hunger, and cleanliness (e.g., `iniciar 50 30 40`).
     - `mostra`: Displays the current state of the Tamagochi, including energy, hunger, cleanliness, diamonds, and age.
     - `brincar`: Plays with the Tamagochi, decreasing energy, hunger, and cleanliness, and increasing the number of diamonds and age.
     - `comer`: Feeds the Tamagochi, decreasing energy, increasing hunger, and decreasing cleanliness.
     - `limpar`: Cleans the Tamagochi, decreasing energy, hunger, and increasing cleanliness.
     - `dormir`: Puts the Tamagochi to sleep, restoring energy, decreasing hunger, and increasing age (requires a certain energy level).
     - `fim`: Exits the program.

5. **Review Output**:
   - The program will display the results of the commands you enter, such as the current state of the Tamagochi or error messages.
