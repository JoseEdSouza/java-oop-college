## Description 📄

The Relationship Management project is a Java program designed to manage relationships between pairs of integers. Users can create a relationship, add pairs of integers to it, check for various properties like reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, and display the relationship's state.

## Usage 🛠️

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

2. **Installation**:
   - No specific installation is required. You can compile and run the program using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **How to Run**:
   - Run the program, and it will await your commands through the console.

4. **Review Output**:
   - The program will display the results of your commands and the current state of the relationship.

## Commands 💬

Here's an explanation of each command and its parameters:

- `createRelation [integer-1] [integer-2] ...`: Create a new relationship and specify its members.
- `addPair [integer-a] [integer-b]`: Add a pair of integers to the current relationship.
- `hasPair [integer-a] [integer-b]`: Check if a pair of integers exists in the current relationship.
- `isReflexive`: Check if the current relationship is reflexive.
- `checkReflexive`: Make the current relationship reflexive by adding missing pairs.
- `isSymmetric`: Check if the current relationship is symmetric.
- `checkSymmetric`: Make the current relationship symmetric by adding missing pairs.
- `isTransitive`: Check if the current relationship is transitive.
- `checkTransitive`: Make the current relationship transitive by adding missing pairs.
- `show`: Display the current state of the relationship.
