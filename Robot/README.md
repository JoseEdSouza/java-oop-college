# 🤖 Robot Word Generator README 📖

This README provides an overview of the Robot Word Generator project, which includes the `Robot` and `App` classes in the `Robot` package. These classes allow users to input a string containing '?' characters and generate all valid word combinations by replacing '?' with 'a' and 'b'. The program filters out invalid word combinations and returns the sorted collection of valid words.

## Description 📄

The Robot Word Generator project is a Java program designed to generate all possible valid word combinations from an input string. The input string may contain '?' characters, which can be replaced with 'a' or 'b' to create combinations. The program filters out invalid combinations, ensuring that no consecutive 'a' characters exist. It then returns a sorted collection of valid word combinations.

## Usage 🛠️

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

2. **Installation**:
   - No specific installation is required. You can compile and run the program using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **How to Run**:
   - Run the `App` class, and it will prompt you to enter a string containing '?' characters. For example: `ab?a?b`.

4. **Interact with the Project**:
   - Input a string containing '?' characters and press Enter.
   - The program will display all valid word combinations after replacing '?' with 'a' or 'b' and filtering out invalid words.

5. **Review Output**:
   - The program will display the sorted collection of valid word combinations.

## Commands 💬

The Robot Word Generator project does not have explicit commands. Instead, it processes the user's input string and generates word combinations accordingly.
